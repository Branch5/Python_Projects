#This repository contains five beginner friendly Python projects.

This is the first time I'm posting projects/code on the internet.
This is a way to show my progress and share my learning journey with the world.
I made these beginner projects in hopes of bettering my Python fundamentals and solidify be base knowledge about the language.

These five Projects include:

1) Dice Rolling Simulator
2) Guess the Number
3) Mad Libs Generator
4) Text-Based Adventure Game (aka Maze of Rooms)
5) Hangman Game (aka Guess the Word)

I got the idea from Youtube Channle: Grant Collins (Playlist: Python Projects for Cybersecurity Complete Series)
